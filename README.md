## Problem Statement
Many students, teachers and researchers view thousands of websites a day as they scour for information. It takes up hours and even days to find the information they need, and most webpages might not even yield the desireed information. Entering a webpage's information to retrieve a summary would be extremely time-saving, removing trouble of reading and comprehending information that they might not need.

## Description
An open-source extractive algorithm which can summarise and extract key bits of information from a given paragraph and output its summary. 
This project hinges on the one key library which is the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org). The package helps to manipulate the paragraphs and sentences to let us calculate the weighted and unweighted frequencies of words and sentences alike.

## Future Plans
This doesn't end here though, I'm planning to take this project up by
* Adding a web interface so people can access it and summarise their paragraphs
* Enhancing the algorithm to make it abstractive
* Using transformers and libraries to make summaries more dynamic
* Using Google APIs to allow users to enter search queries and get webpages to scrape and summarise
